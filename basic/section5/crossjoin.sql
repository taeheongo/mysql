-- Introduction to MySQL CROSS JOIN clause

-- syntax:
SELECT * FROM t1
CROSS JOIN t2;

-- examples:
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS salesdb;
USE salesdb;

CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(13,2 )
);

CREATE TABLE stores (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    store_name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE sales (
    product_id INT,
    store_id INT,
    quantity DECIMAL(13 , 2 ) NOT NULL,
    sales_date DATE NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (product_id , store_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id)
        REFERENCES products (id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (store_id)
        REFERENCES stores (id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

-- MySQL CROSS JOIN example
-- This statement returns total sales for each store and product, you calculate the sales and group them by store and product as follows:
SELECT 
    store_name,
    product_name,
    SUM(quantity * price) AS revenue
FROM
    sales
        INNER JOIN
    products ON products.id = sales.product_id
        INNER JOIN
    stores ON stores.id = sales.store_id
GROUP BY store_name , product_name;

-- Now, what if you want to know also which store had no sales of a specific product. The query above could not answer this question.

-- First, use the CROSS JOIN clause to get the combination of all stores and products:

SELECT 
    store_name, product_name
FROM
    stores AS a
        CROSS JOIN
    products AS b;

-- Next, join the result of the query above with a query that returns the total of sales by store and product. The following query illustrates the idea:

SELECT 
    b.store_name,
    a.product_name,
    IFNULL(c.revenue, 0) AS revenue
FROM
    products AS a
        CROSS JOIN
    stores AS b
        LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT 
        stores.id AS store_id,
        products.id AS product_id,
        store_name,
            product_name,
            ROUND(SUM(quantity * price), 0) AS revenue
    FROM
        sales
    INNER JOIN products ON products.id = sales.product_id
    INNER JOIN stores ON stores.id = sales.store_id
    GROUP BY stores.id, products.id, store_name , product_name) AS c ON c.store_id = b.id
        AND c.product_id= a.id
ORDER BY b.store_name;
